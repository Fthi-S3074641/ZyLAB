negative	the story is also as unoriginal as they come , already having been recycled more times than i'd care to count . 
negative	a sentimental mess that never rings true . 
negative	there is a difference between movies with the courage to go over the top and movies that don't care about being stupid
negative	the execution is so pedestrian that the most positive comment we can make is that rob schneider actually turns in a pretty convincing performance as a prissy teenage girl . 
negative	the party scenes deliver some tawdry kicks . the rest of the film . . . is dudsville .

negative	dull and mechanical , kinda like a very goofy museum exhibit
negative	completely awful iranian drama . . . as much fun as a grouchy ayatollah in a cold mosque . 
negative	there's no doubting that this is a highly ambitious and personal project for egoyan , but it's also one that , next to his best work , feels clumsy and convoluted . 
negative	i'm not saying that ice age doesn't have some fairly pretty pictures , but there's not enough substance in the story to actually give them life . 
negative	beautifully filmed and well acted . . . but admittedly problematic in its narrative specifics . 
negative	off the hook is overlong and not well-acted , but credit writer-producer-director adam watstein with finishing it at all . 
negative	will probably be one of those movies barely registering a blip on the radar screen of 2002 .

negative	i found myself growing more and more frustrated and detached as vincent became more and more abhorrent . 
negative	thoroughly awful . 
negative	truly terrible . 
negative	rifkin no doubt fancies himself something of a hubert selby jr . , but there isn't an ounce of honest poetry in his entire script ; it's simply crude and unrelentingly exploitative . 
negative	the dialogue is very choppy and monosyllabic despite the fact that it is being dubbed . 
negative	there's undeniable enjoyment to be had from films crammed with movie references , but the fun wears thin -- then out -- when there's nothing else happening . 
negative	the film favors the scientific over the spectacular ( visually speaking ) . 
negative	this cloying , voices-from-the-other-side story is hell . 
negative	puts on airs of a hal hartley wannabe film -- without the vital comic ingredient of the hilarious writer-director himself .

negative	it's hard to imagine any recent film , independent or otherwise , that makes as much of a mess as this one . 
negative	as is often the case with ambitious , eager first-time filmmakers , mr . murray , a prolific director of music videos , stuffs his debut with more plot than it can comfortably hold . 
negative	it's not only dull because we've seen [eddie] murphy do the genial-rogue shtick to death , but because the plot is equally hackneyed . 
negative	it's sincere to a fault , but , unfortunately , not very compelling or much fun . 
negative	a muddled limp biscuit of a movie , a vampire soap opera that doesn't make much sense even on its own terms . 
negative	it's rare to see a movie that takes such a speedy swan dive from " promising " to " interesting " to " familiar " before landing squarely on " stupid " . 
negative	looks more like a travel-agency video targeted at people who like to ride bikes topless and roll in the mud than a worthwhile glimpse of independent-community guiding lights .

negative	as pure over-the-top trash , any john waters movie has it beat by a country mile . 
negative	that the chuck norris " grenade gag " occurs about 7 times during windtalkers is a good indication of how serious-minded the film is .

negative	a wildly erratic drama with sequences that make you wince in embarrassment and others , thanks to the actors , that are quite touching . 
negative	crikey indeed . 
negative	the sheer dumbness of the plot ( other than its one good idea ) and the movie's inescapable air of sleaziness get you down . 
negative	this flat run at a hip-hop tootsie is so poorly paced you could fit all of pootie tang in between its punchlines . 
negative	a humorless journey into a philosophical void . 
negative	the movie attempts to mine laughs from a genre -- the gangster/crime comedy -- that wore out its welcome with audiences several years ago , and its cutesy reliance on movie-specific cliches isn't exactly endearing .

negative	a showcase for both the scenic splendor of the mountains and for legendary actor michel serrault , the film is less successful on other levels . 
negative	most of the storylines feel like time fillers between surf shots . the movie isn't horrible , but you can see mediocre cresting on the next wave . 
negative	the sequel plays out like a flimsy excuse to give blade fans another look at wesley snipes' iconic hero doing battle with dozens of bad guys -- at once .

negative	ultimately , in the history of the academy , people may be wondering what all that jazz was about " chicago " in 2002 . zellweger's whiny pouty-lipped poof faced and spindly attempt at playing an ingenue makes her nomination as best actress even more of a an a

negative	an affable but undernourished romantic comedy that fails to match the freshness of the actress-producer and writer's previous collaboration , miss congeniality . 
negative	the audience when i saw this one was chuckling at all the wrong times , and that's a bad sign when they're supposed to be having a collective heart attack .

negative	the movie slides downhill as soon as macho action conventions assert themselves . 
negative	jones helps breathe some life into the insubstantial plot , but even he is overwhelmed by predictability . 
negative	 " analyze that " is one of those crass , contrived sequels that not only fails on its own , but makes you second-guess your affection for the original . 
negative	goldmember has none of the visual wit of the previous pictures , and it looks as though jay roach directed the film from the back of a taxicab . 
negative	the jokes are sophomoric , stereotypes are sprinkled everywhere and the acting ranges from bad to bodacious . 
negative	the movie is a lumbering load of hokum but . . . it's at least watchable . 
negative	the problem is that the movie has no idea of it is serious or not . 
negative	simply doesn't have sufficient heft to justify its two-hour running time . 
negative	not only is it hokey , manipulative and as bland as wonder bread dipped in milk , but it also does the absolute last thing we need hollywood doing to us : it preaches . 
negative	the movie has a script ( by paul pender ) made of wood , and it's relentlessly folksy , a procession of stagy set pieces stacked with binary oppositions . 
negative	what's needed so badly but what is virtually absent here is either a saving dark humor or the feel of poetic tragedy .

negative	the whole affair , true story or not , feels incredibly hokey . . . [it] comes off like a hallmark commercial . 
negative	normally , rohmer's talky films fascinate me , but when he moves his setting to the past , and relies on a historical text , he loses the richness of characterization that makes his films so memorable . 
negative	though it goes further than both , anyone who has seen the hunger or cat people will find little new here , but a tasty performance from vincent gallo lifts this tale of cannibal lust above the ordinary . 
negative	an ill-conceived jumble that's not scary , not smart and not engaging .

negative	louiso lets the movie dawdle in classic disaffected-indie-film mode , and brother hoffman's script stumbles over a late-inning twist that just doesn't make sense . 
negative	 . . . overly melodramatic . . . 
negative	patchy combination of soap opera , low-tech magic realism and , at times , ploddingly sociological commentary . 
negative	 . . . generically , forgettably pleasant from start to finish . 
negative	ringu is a disaster of a story , full of holes and completely lacking in chills . ignore the reputation , and ignore the film . 
negative	even in terms of the low-grade cheese standards on which it operates , it never quite makes the grade as tawdry trash . 
negative	too intensely focused on the travails of being hal hartley to function as pastiche , no such thing is hartley's least accessible screed yet . 
negative	extremely bad . 
negative	the script boasts some tart tv-insider humor , but the film has not a trace of humanity or empathy . 
negative	the original wasn't a good movie but this remake makes it look like a masterpiece ! 
negative	there's no palpable chemistry between lopez and male lead ralph fiennes , plus the script by working girl scribe kevin wade is workmanlike in the extreme . 
negative	spain's greatest star wattage doesn't overcome the tumult of maudlin tragedy . 
negative	suffers from all the excesses of the genre . 
negative	they ought to be a whole lot scarier than they are in this tepid genre offering . 
negative	a horror movie with seriously dumb characters , which somewhat dilutes the pleasure of watching them stalked by creepy-crawly bug things that live only in the darkness . 
negative	the predominantly amateur cast is painful to watch , so stilted and unconvincing are the performances . 
negative	i'm sure the filmmaker would disagree , but , honestly , i don't see the point . it's a visual rorschach test and i must have failed . 
negative	clayburgh and tambor are charming performers ; neither of them deserves eric schaeffer . 
negative	the adventure doesn't contain half the excitement of balto , or quarter the fun of toy story 2 . 
negative	solaris is rigid and evasive in ways that soderbergh's best films , " erin brockovich , " " out of sight " and " ocean's eleven , " never were . 
negative	 . . . del toro maintains a dark mood that makes the film seem like something to endure instead of enjoy . 
negative	a movie in which laughter and self-exploitation merge into jolly soft-porn 'empowerment . '
negative	this thing works on no level whatsoever for me . 
negative	more dutiful than enchanting . . . terribly episodic and lacking the spark of imagination that might have made it an exhilarating treat . 
negative	cinematic pyrotechnics aside , the only thing avary seems to care about are mean giggles and pulchritude . it makes sense that he went back to school to check out the girls -- his film is a frat boy's idea of a good time . 
negative	what might have been acceptable on the printed page of iles' book does not translate well to the screen . 
negative	since the movie is based on a nicholas sparks best seller , you know death is lurking around the corner , just waiting to spoil things . 
negative	fear dot com is more frustrating than a modem that disconnects every 10 seconds . 
negative	lacking substance and soul , crossroads comes up shorter than britney's cutoffs . 
negative	without non-stop techno or the existential overtones of a kieslowski morality tale , maelstrï¿½m is just another winter sleepers . 
negative	[e]ventually , every idea in this film is flushed down the latrine of heroism . 
negative	indifferently implausible popcorn programmer of a movie . 
negative	they should have called it gutterball . 
negative	slick piece of cross-promotion . 
negative	villeneuve spends too much time wallowing in bibi's generic angst ( there are a lot of shots of her gazing out windows ) . 
negative	apart from dazzling cinematography , we've seen just about everything in blue crush in one form or the other . 
negative	very special effects , brilliantly bold colors and heightened reality can't hide the giant achilles' heel in " stuart little 2 " : there's just no story , folks . 
negative	there is no pleasure in watching a child suffer . just embarrassment and a vague sense of shame . 
negative	full of witless jokes , dealing in broad stereotypes and outrageously unbelievable scenarios , and saddled with a general air of misogyny
negative	should have been someone else-
negative	ï¿½ is an arthritic attempt at directing by callie khouri . i had to look away - this was god awful . 
negative	though moonlight mile is replete with acclaimed actors and actresses and tackles a subject that's potentially moving , the movie is too predictable and too self-conscious to reach a level of high drama . 
negative	it's hard to like a film about a guy who is utterly unlikeable , and shiner , starring michael caine as an aging british boxing promoter desperate for a taste of fame and fortune , is certainly that . 
negative	it appears that something has been lost in the translation to the screen . 
negative	this movie is something of an impostor itself , stretching and padding its material in a blur of dead ends and distracting camera work . 
negative	a working class " us vs . them " opera that leaves no heartstring untugged and no liberal cause unplundered . 
negative	expect the same-old , lame-old slasher nonsense , just with different scenery . 
negative	try as i may , i can't think of a single good reason to see this movie , even though everyone in my group extemporaneously shouted , 'thank you ! ' when leguizamo finally plugged an irritating character late in the movie . 
negative	a valueless kiddie paean to pro basketball underwritten by the nba . 
negative	it has its moments of swaggering camaraderie , but more often just feels generic , derivative and done to death . 
negative	while [hill] has learned new tricks , the tricks alone are not enough to salvage this lifeless boxing film . 
negative	sometimes seems less like storytelling than something the otherwise compelling director needed to get off his chest . 
negative	well-nigh unendurable . . . though the picture strains to become cinematic poetry , it remains depressingly prosaic and dull . 
negative	the twist that ends the movie is the one with the most emotional resonance , but twists are getting irritating , and this is the kind of material where the filmmakers should be very careful about raising eyebrows . 
negative	forced , familiar and thoroughly condescending . 
negative	whaley's determination to immerse you in sheer , unrelenting wretchedness is exhausting . 
negative	made with no discernible craft and monstrously sanctimonious in dealing with childhood loss . 
negative	if it's seldom boring , well , it's also rarely coherent . 
negative	makes for some truly odd , at times confusing , kids entertainment . . . but at least this time there's some centered storytelling to go along with all the weird stuff . 
negative	this is nothing but familiar territory . 
negative	the film's few ideas are stretched to the point of evaporation ; the whole central section is one big chase that seems to have no goal and no urgency . it's just filler . 
negative	they takes a long time to get to its gasp-inducing ending . 
negative	from the opening scenes , it's clear that all about the benjamins is a totally formulaic movie . 
negative	by getting myself wrapped up in the visuals and eccentricities of many of the characters , i found myself confused when it came time to get to the heart of the movie . 
negative	do not see this film . 
negative	in exactly 89 minutes , most of which passed as slowly as if i'd been sitting naked on an igloo , formula 51 sank from quirky to jerky to utter turkey . 
negative	while the resident evil games may have set new standards for thrills , suspense , and gore for video games , the movie really only succeeds in the third of these . 
negative	it's difficult to imagine the process that produced such a script , but here's guessing that spray cheese and underarm noises played a crucial role . 
negative	not an objectionable or dull film ; it merely lacks everything except good intentions . 
negative	all the amped-up tony hawk-style stunts and thrashing rap-metal can't disguise the fact that , really , we've been here , done that . 
negative	for all the writhing and wailing , tears , rage and opium overdoses , there's no sense of actual passion being washed away in love's dissolution . 
negative	it's one pussy-ass world when even killer-thrillers revolve around group therapy sessions . 
negative	paid in full is so stale , in fact , that its most vibrant scene is one that uses clips from brian de palma's scarface . that's a cheat . 
negative	basically a static series of semi-improvised ( and semi-coherent ) raps between the stars . 
negative	 . . . a hollow joke told by a cinematic gymnast having too much fun embellishing the misanthropic tale to actually engage it . 
negative	the script isn't very good ; not even someone as gifted as hoffman ( the actor ) can make it work . 
negative	i'll bet the video game is a lot more fun than the film . 
negative	i'm guessing the director is a magician . after all , he took three minutes of dialogue , 30 seconds of plot and turned them into a 90-minute movie that feels five hours long . 
negative	don't be fooled by the impressive cast list - eye see you is pure junk . 
negative	this movie seems to have been written using mad-libs . there can be no other explanation . hilariously inept and ridiculous . 
negative	given how heavy-handed and portent-heavy it is , this could be the worst thing soderbergh has ever done . 
negative	with the exception of some fleetingly amusing improvisations by cedric the entertainer as perry's boss , there isn't a redeeming moment here . 
negative	no one but a convict guilty of some truly heinous crime should have to sit through the master of disguise . 
negative	despite the evocative aesthetics evincing the hollow state of modern love life , the film never percolates beyond a monotonous whine . 
negative	comes . . . uncomfortably close to coasting in the treads of the bicycle thief . 
negative	i don't think i laughed out loud once . and when you're talking about a slapstick comedy , that's a pretty big problem . 
negative	my reaction in a word : disappointment . his last movie was poetically romantic and full of indelible images , but his latest has nothing going for it . 
negative	feels haphazard , as if the writers mistakenly thought they could achieve an air of frantic spontaneity by simply tossing in lots of characters doing silly stuff and stirring the pot . 
negative	the vintage is pure '87 , with a halfhearted twist on its cautionary message : fatal attraction = don't have an affair with a nutjob ; unfaithful = don't if you're married to one . 
negative	[w]hile long on amiable monkeys and worthy environmentalism , jane goodall's wild chimpanzees is short on the thrills the oversize medium demands . 
negative	it's mighty tedious for the viewer who has to contend with unpleasant characters , hit-and-miss performances and awkwardly staged scenes . 
negative	scorsese at his best makes gangster films that are equally lovely but also relentlessly brutal and brutally intelligent ; perdition , meanwhile , reads more like driving miss daisy than goodfellas . 
negative	 . . . the film suffers from a lack of humor ( something needed to balance out the violence ) . . . 
negative	the so-inept- it's-surreal dubbing ( featuring the voices of glenn close , regis philbin and breckin meyer ) brings back memories of cheesy old godzilla flicks . 
negative	fancy a real downer ? [leigh] lays it on so thick this time that it feels like a suicide race . 
negative	there's a solid woman- finding-herself story somewhere in here , but you'd have to dig pretty deep to uncover it . 
negative	sam mendes has become valedictorian at the school for soft landings and easy ways out . 
negative	the problem with this film is that it lacks focus . i sympathize with the plight of these families , but the movie doesn't do a very good job conveying the issue at hand . 
negative	 . . . a plotline that's as lumpy as two-day old porridge . . . the filmmakers' paws , sad to say , were all over this " un-bear-able " project ! 
negative	a relative letdown . 
negative	this rather superficial arthouse middle-brow film knows how to please a crowd , and that's about all it does well . 
negative	the film's tone and pacing are off almost from the get-go . 
negative	coughs and sputters on its own postmodern conceit . 
negative	there are plot holes big enough for shamu the killer whale to swim through . 
negative	it uses the pain and violence of war as background material for color . 
negative	the affectionate loopiness that once seemed congenital to demme's perspective has a tough time emerging from between the badly dated cutesy-pie mystery scenario and the newfangled hollywood post-production effects . 
negative	 . . . plot holes so large and obvious a marching band might as well be stomping through them in clown clothes , playing a college football fight song on untuned instruments . 
negative	the action switches between past and present , but the material link is too tenuous to anchor the emotional connections that purport to span a 125-year divide . 
negative	there ought to be a directing license , so that ed burns can have his revoked . 
negative	i can take infantile humor . . . but this is the sort of infantile that makes you wonder about changing the director and writer's diapers . 
negative	a lackluster , unessential sequel to the classic disney adaptation of j . m . barrie's peter pan . 
negative	while there's something intrinsically funny about sir anthony hopkins saying 'get in the car , bitch , ' this jerry bruckheimer production has little else to offer
negative	if you've ever entertained the notion of doing what the title of this film implies , what sex with strangers actually shows may put you off the idea forever . 
negative	every time you look , sweet home alabama is taking another bummer of a wrong turn . 
negative	jason x is positively anti-darwinian : nine sequels and 400 years later , the teens are none the wiser and jason still kills on auto-pilot . 
negative	the only excitement comes when the credits finally roll and you get to leave the theater . 
negative	one of those pictures whose promising , if rather precious , premise is undercut by amateurish execution . 
negative	deadeningly dull , mired in convoluted melodrama , nonsensical jargon and stiff-upper-lip laboriousness . 
negative	another in-your-face wallow in the lower depths made by people who have never sung those blues . 
negative	something akin to a japanese alice through the looking glass , except that it seems to take itself far more seriously . 
negative	makes for a pretty unpleasant viewing experience . 
negative	may reawaken discussion of the kennedy assassination but this fictional film looks made for cable rather than for the big screen . 
negative	the man from elysian fields is a cold , bliss-less work that groans along thinking itself some important comment on how life throws us some beguiling curves . 
negative	a solid film . . . but more conscientious than it is truly stirring . 
negative	mcconaughey's fun to watch , the dragons are okay , not much fire in the script . 
negative	returning aggressively to his formula of dimwitted comedy and even dimmer characters , sandler , who also executive produces , has made a film that makes previous vehicles look smart and sassy . 
negative	whenever its story isn't bogged down by idiocy involving the cia and a lost u . s . satellite , hunter -- starring irwin and his american wife/colleague , terri -- is a movie children should enjoy . 
negative	irwin is a man with enough charisma and audacity to carry a dozen films , but this particular result is ultimately held back from being something greater . 
negative	nervous breakdowns are not entertaining . 
negative	even film silliness needs a little gravity , beyond good hair and humping . 
negative	it's played in the most straight-faced fashion , with little humor to lighten things up . the heavy-handed film is almost laughable as a consequence . 
negative	scooby dooby doo / and shaggy too / you both look and sound great . / but daphne , you're too buff / fred thinks he's tough / and velma - wow , you've lost weight ! 
negative	some of their jokes work , but most fail miserably and in the end , pumpkin is far more offensive than it is funny . 
negative	the title not only describes its main characters , but the lazy people behind the camera as well . 
negative	it should be mentioned that the set design and interiors of the haunted vessel are more than effectively creepy and moodily lit . so i just did . 
negative	for anyone who grew up on disney's 1950 treasure island , or remembers the 1934 victor fleming classic , this one feels like an impostor . 
negative	remember when bond had more glamour than clamor ? no more . 
negative	 . . . hudlin is stuck trying to light a fire with soggy leaves . 
negative	there's no real reason to see it , and no real reason not to . 
negative	to say analyze that is de niro's best film since meet the parents sums up the sad state of his recent career . 
negative	another week , another gross-out college comedy--ugh . 
negative	when [de palma's] bad , he's really bad , and femme fatale ranks with the worst he has done . 
negative	the only thing worse than your substandard , run-of-the-mill hollywood picture is an angst-ridden attempt to be profound . 
negative	in the end , ted bundy's only justification is the director's common but unexplored fascination with the frustrated maniac ; there's no larger point , and little social context . 
negative	soul is what's lacking in every character in this movie and , subsequently , the movie itself . 
negative	it's got its heart in the right place , but it also wilts after awhile . 
negative	if shayamalan wanted to tell a story about a man who loses his faith , why didn't he just do it , instead of using bad sci-fi as window dressing ? 
negative	if you liked the 1982 film then , you'll still like it now . 
negative	it delivers some chills and sustained unease , but flounders in its quest for deeper meaning . 
negative	a mawkish , implausible platonic romance that makes chaplin's city lights seem dispassionate by comparison . 
negative	literally nothing in the pool is new , but if you grew up on the stalker flicks of the 1980's this one should appease you for 90 minutes . 
negative	unwieldy contraption . 
negative	so what is the point ? lovingly choreographed bloodshed taking place in a pristine movie neverland , basically . 
negative	you see robert de niro singing - and dancing to - west side story show tunes . choose your reaction : a . ) that sure is funny ! b . ) that sure is pathetic ! 
negative	instead of accurately accounting a terrible true story , the film's more determined to become the next texas chainsaw massacre . but what about the countless other people who'd merely like to watch a solid tale about a universally interesting soul ? 
negative	a battle between bug-eye theatre and dead-eye matinee . 
negative	this miserable excuse of a movie runs on empty , believing flatbush machismo will get it through . 
negative	every good actor needs to do his or her own hamlet . for benigni it wasn't shakespeare whom he wanted to define his career with but pinocchio . it might as well have been problem child iv . 
negative	we are left with a superficial snapshot that , however engaging , is insufficiently enlightening and inviting . 
negative	obvious politics and rudimentary animation reduce the chances that the appeal of hey arnold ! the movie will reach far beyond its core demographic . 
negative	anthony hopkins ? big deal ! we've already seen the prequel to the silence of the lambs and hannibal -- and it was better the first time . 
negative	it's not that waiting for happiness is a bad film , because it isn't . it's just incredibly dull . 
negative	it wants to be thought of as a subversive little indie film , but it has all the qualities of a modern situation comedy . 
negative	the story's so preposterous that i didn't believe it for a second , despite the best efforts of everyone involved . 
negative	de niro and mcdormand give solid performances , but their screen time is sabotaged by the story's inability to create interest . 
negative	it is a comedy that's not very funny and an action movie that is not very thrilling ( and an uneasy alliance , at that ) . 
negative	flat , but with a revelatory performance by michelle williams . 
negative	the sum of all fears is almost impossible to follow -- and there's something cringe-inducing about seeing an american football stadium nuked as pop entertainment . 
negative	ihops don't pile on this much syrup . 
negative	with a story as bizarre and mysterious as this , you don't want to be worrying about whether the ineffectual broomfield is going to have the courage to knock on that door . 
negative	 . . . fifty minutes of tedious adolescent melodramatics followed by thirty-five minutes of inflated nonsense . 
negative	there's no denying the elaborateness of the artist's conceptions , nor his ability to depict them with outrageous elan , but really the whole series is so much pretentious nonsense , lavishly praised by those who equate obscurity with profundity . 
negative	no reason for anyone to invest their hard-earned bucks into a movie which obviously didn't invest much into itself either . 
negative	an afterschool special without the courage of its convictions . 
negative	watching it is rather like viewing a long soap opera in which only the first episode was any good . 
negative	i didn't laugh at the ongoing efforts of cube , and his skinny buddy mike epps , to make like laurel and hardy 'n the hood . 
negative	[it's] a prison soccer movie starring charismatic tough guy vinnie jones , but it had too much spitting for me to enjoy . 
negative	feels like one of those contrived , only-in -hollywood productions where name actors deliver big performances created for the sole purpose of generating oscar talk . 
negative	pretentious editing ruins a potentially terrific flick . 
negative	this is really just another genre picture . 
negative	'carente de imaginaciï¿½n , mal dirigida , peor actuada y sin un ï¿½pice de romance , es una verdadera pï¿½rdida de tiempo y dinero'
negative	a dreary , incoherent , self-indulgent mess of a movie in which a bunch of pompous windbags drone on inanely for two hours . . . a cacophony of pretentious , meaningless prattle . 
negative	just like hearst's enormous yacht , it's slow and unwieldy and takes a long time to reach its destination . 
negative	 . . . too gory to be a comedy and too silly to be an effective horror film . 
negative	somehow both wildly implausible and strangely conventional . 
negative	kidman is really the only thing that's worth watching in birthday girl , a film by the stage-trained jez butterworth ( mojo ) that serves as yet another example of the sad decline of british comedies in the post-full monty world . 
negative	'unfaithful' cheats on itself and retreats to comfortable territory . too bad . 
negative	an awful snooze . 
negative	wallace seems less like he's been burning to tell a war story than he's been itching to somehow tack one together
negative	godawful boring slug of a movie . 
negative	the tug-of-war at the core of beijing bicycle becomes weighed down with agonizing contrivances , overheated pathos and long , wistful gazes . 
negative	mark me down as a non-believer in werewolf films that are not serious and rely on stupidity as a substitute for humor . 
negative	a soggy , cliche-bound epic-horror yarn that ends up being even dumber than its title . 
negative	with spy kids 2 : the island of lost dreams writer/director/producer robert rodriguez has cobbled together a film that feels like a sugar high gone awry . 
negative	divertingly ridiculous , headbangingly noisy . 
negative	if you collected all the moments of coherent dialogue , they still wouldn't add up to the time required to boil a four- minute egg . 
negative	spousal abuse is a major problem in contemporary society , but the film reduces this domestic tragedy to florid melodrama . 
negative	it tries too hard , and overreaches the logic of its own world . 
negative	with recent tensions rekindled by the kathleen soliah trial and the upcoming trial of sla members emily and william harris , not to mention sept . 11 , its difficult these days to appreciate fire's bright side . 
negative	faultlessly professional but finally slight . 
negative	there's more scatological action in 8 crazy nights than a proctologist is apt to encounter in an entire career . 
negative	if we don't demand a standard of quality for the art that we choose , we deserve the trash that we get . 
negative	all ms . jovovich , as the sanctified heroine , has to do is look radiant , grimly purposeful and mildly alarmed while forcing open doors , wielding wrenches and fleeing monsters . 
negative	better at putting you to sleep than a sound machine . 
negative	credibility sinks into a mire of sentiment . 
negative	so stupid , so ill-conceived , so badly drawn , it created whole new levels of ugly . 
negative	a long-winded and stagy session of romantic contrivances that never really gels like the shrewd feminist fairy tale it could have been . 
negative	what would jesus do if he was a film director ? he'd create a movie better than this . 
negative	i'm afraid you won't get through this frankly fantastical by-the-numbers b-flick with just a suspension of disbelief . rather , you'll have to wrestle disbelief to the ground and then apply the chloroform-soaked handkerchief . 
negative	let's cut to the consumer-advice bottom line : stay home . 
negative	plays like one of those conversations that comic book guy on " the simpsons " has . 
negative	 " juwanna mann ? " no thanks . wewannour money back , actually . 
negative	some actors steal scenes . tom green just gives them a bad odor . this self-infatuated goofball is far from the only thing wrong with the clumsy comedy stealing harvard , but he's the most obvious one . 
negative	a monster combat thriller as impersonal in its relentlessness as the videogame series that inspired it . 
negative	director barry skolnick and his screenwriters glibly tick off every point of " the longest yard " playbook like a checklist . 
negative	one minute , you think you're watching a serious actioner ; the next , it's as though clips from the pink panther strikes again and/or sailor moon have been spliced in . 
negative	these spiders can outrun a motorcycle and wrap a person in a sticky cocoon in seconds , but they fall short of being interesting or entertaining . 
negative	everyone connected to this movie seems to be part of an insider clique , which tends to breed formulaic films rather than fresh ones . 
negative	it's never a good sign when a film's star spends the entirety of the film in a coma . it's a worse sign when you begin to envy her condition . 
negative	director dirk shafer and co-writer greg hinton ride the dubious divide where gay porn reaches for serious drama . 
negative	falters when it takes itself too seriously and when it depends too heavily on its otherwise talented cast to clown in situations that aren't funny . 
negative	this idea has lost its originality . . . and neither star appears very excited at rehashing what was basically a one-joke picture . 
negative	too silly to be frightening , too stolid to be funny , it projects the same lazy affability as its nominal star , david arquette . 
negative	all that ( powerpuff girls ) charm is present in the movie , but it's spread too thin . 
negative	its save-the-planet message clashes with its crass marketing . 
negative	feels like six different movies fighting each other for attention . 
negative	bartleby is a one-joke movie , and a bad joke at that . 
negative	despite the premise of a good story . . . it wastes all its star power on cliched or meaningless roles . 
negative	it's difficult to say whether the tuxedo is more boring or embarrassing--i'm prepared to call it a draw . 
negative	a long-winded , predictable scenario . 
negative	this movie is about lying , cheating , but loving the friends you betray . 
negative	a dreary rip-off of goodfellas that serves as a muddled and offensive cautionary tale for hispanic americans . 
negative	lawrence preaches strictly to the converted . 
negative	 . . . the film falls back on the same old formula of teen sex , outrageous pranks and scenes designed to push the envelope of bad taste for laughs . 
negative	despite its title , amy's orgasm is not a porno , though it is as tedious as one . 
negative	without september 11 , collateral damage would have been just another bad movie . now it's a bad , embarrassing movie . 
negative	there's something fundamental missing from this story : something or someone to care about . 
negative	[it's] difficult to get beyond the overall blandness of american chai , despite its likable performances and refreshingly naive point of view . 
negative	too stupid to be satire , too obviously hateful to be classified otherwise , frank novak's irritating slice of lumpen life is as reliably soul-killing as its title is nearly meaningless . 
negative	these people wouldn't know subtle characterization if it put on a giant furry monster costume and then gave them a lapdance . 
negative	about as satisfying and predictable as the fare at your local drive through . 
negative	too simple for its own good . 
negative	a trashy , exploitative , thoroughly unpleasant experience . 
negative	it's exactly what you'd expect . 
negative	if somebody was bored and . . . decided to make a dull , pretentious version of jesus' son , they'd come up with something like bart freundlich's world traveler . 
negative	ben affleck as jack ryan , tom clancy's intrepid hero ? ridiculous . what's next ? d . j . qualls as indiana jones ? or tom green as han solo ? 
negative	this formulaic chiller will do little to boost stallone's career . 
negative	the plot is so predictable and sentimental that viewers are likely to lose interest before sandrine and her goats walk off into the sunset . 
negative	technically , the film is about as interesting as an insurance commercial . 
negative	it's a movie forged in the fires of chick flick hell . 
negative	credit must be given to harland williams , michael rosenbaum and barry watson , who inject far more good-natured spirit and talent into this project than it deserves
negative	there's an audience for it , but it could have been funnier and more innocent . 
negative	all the well-meaningness in the world can't erase the fact that the believer feels like a 12-step program for the jewish nazi . 
negative	'dragonfly' is a movie about a bus wreck that turns into a film wreck . 
negative	a minor picture with a major identity crisis -- it's sort of true and it's sort of bogus and it's ho-hum all the way through . 
negative	the reason i found myself finally unmoved by this film , which is immaculately produced and has serious things to say , is that it comes across rather too plainly as allegory . 
negative	high crimes miscasts nearly every leading character . 
negative	with danilo donati's witty designs and dante spinotti's luscious cinematography , this might have made a decent children's movie -- if only benigni hadn't insisted on casting himself in the title role . 
negative	 " the kid stays in the picture " is a great story , terrifically told by the man who wrote it but this cliff notes edition is a cheat . 
negative	just one more collection of penis , breast and flatulence gags in search of a story . or a profit . or some damn thing . 
negative	gee , a second assassin shot kennedy ? moot point . 
negative	even the imaginative gore can't hide the musty scent of todd farmer's screenplay , which is a simple retread of the 1979 alien , with a plucky heroine battling a monster loose in a spaceship . 
negative	though the book runs only about 300 pages , it is so densely packed . . . that even an ambitious adaptation and elaborate production like mr . schepisi's seems skimpy and unclear . 
negative	 . . . perhaps the heaviest , most joyless movie ever made about giant dragons taking over the world . 
negative	i admire it and yet cannot recommend it , because it overstays its natural running time . 
negative	despite some gulps the film is a fuzzy huggy . 
negative	aaliyah rarely dampens her diva persona enough to spark genuine chemistry with townsend . when she speaks , her creepy egyptian demigod voice is as computer processed and overproduced as it was in her music . 
negative	[nelson's] movie about morally compromised figures leaves viewers feeling compromised , unable to find their way out of the fog and the ashes . 
negative	even die-hard fans of japanese animation . . . will find this one a challenge . 
negative	the situations and jokes are as predictable and as lowbrow as the endless pratfalls the boys take in their high heels . 
negative	automatically pegs itself for the straight-to-video sci-fi rental shelf . 
negative	a standard haunted house tale transplanted to the high seas . 
negative	the angst-ridden , affluent slacker characters are more grating than engaging . 
negative	say this for the soundtrack , it drowns out the lousy dialogue . 
negative	maudlin and melodramatic we expected . boring we didn't .

negative	solondz may be convinced that he has something significant to say , but he isn't talking a talk that appeals to me . 
negative	isn't it a bit early in his career for director barry sonnenfeld to do a homage to himself ? and it's a lousy one at that . 
negative	everything about girls can't swim , even its passages of sensitive observation , feels secondhand , familiar -- and not in a good way . 
negative	muddled , simplistic and more than a little pretentious . 
negative	dong never pushes for insights beyond the superficial tensions of the dynamic he's dissecting , and the film settles too easily along the contours of expectation . 
negative	this pathetic junk is barely an hour long . nevertheless , it still seems endless . 
negative	the leads are so unmemorable , despite several attempts at lengthy dialogue scenes , that one eventually resents having to inhale this gutter romancer's secondhand material . 
negative	plays like the old disease-of-the-week small-screen melodramas . 
negative	so exaggerated and broad that it comes off as annoying rather than charming . 
negative	chalk it up as the worst kind of hubristic folly . 
negative	a sleek advert for youthful anomie that never quite equals the sum of its pretensions . 
negative	depressingly thin and exhaustingly contrived . only masochistic moviegoers need apply . 
negative	it's a frankenstein-monster of a film that doesn't know what it wants to be . 
negative	after a while , the only way for a reasonably intelligent person to get through the country bears is to ponder how a whole segment of pop-music history has been allowed to get wet , fuzzy and sticky . 
negative	too bad kramer couldn't make a guest appearance to liven things up . 
negative	a dull , dumb and derivative horror film . 
negative	the fact that the 'best part' of the movie comes from a 60-second homage to one of demme's good films doesn't bode well for the rest of it . 
negative	the sequel is everything the original was not : contrived , overblown and tie-in ready . 
negative	it's so devoid of joy and energy it makes even jason x . . . look positively shakesperean by comparison . 
negative	mctiernan's remake may be lighter on its feet -- the sober-minded original was as graceful as a tap-dancing rhino -- but it is just as boring and as obvious . 
negative	an incredibly irritating comedy about thoroughly vacuous people . . . manages to embody the worst excesses of nouvelle vague without any of its sense of fun or energy . 
negative	the superior plotline isn't quite enough to drag along the dead ( water ) weight of the other . 
negative	a woefully dull , redundant concept that bears more than a whiff of exploitation , despite iwai's vaunted empathy . 
negative	the star who helped give a spark to " chasing amy " and " changing lanes " falls flat as thinking man cia agent jack ryan in this summer's new action film , " the sum of all fears . " 
negative	any enjoyment will be hinge from a personal threshold of watching sad but endearing characters do extremely unconventional things . 
negative	it's difficult to discern if this is a crazy work of disturbed genius or merely 90 minutes of post-adolescent electra rebellion . 
negative	it almost feels as if the movie is more interested in entertaining itself than in amusing us . 
negative	full frontal , which opens today nationwide , could almost be classified as a movie-industry satire , but it lacks the generous inclusiveness that is the genre's definitive , if disingenuous , feature . 
negative	it's possible that something hip and transgressive was being attempted here that stubbornly refused to gel , but the result is more puzzling than unsettling . 
negative	collateral damage offers formula payback and the big payoff , but the explosions tend to simply hit their marks , pyro-correctly . 
negative	the whole thing plays like a tired tyco ad . 
negative	one well-timed explosion in a movie can be a knockout , but a hundred of them can be numbing . proof of this is ballistic : ecks vs . sever . 
negative	'wouldn't it be nice if all guys got a taste of what it's like on the other side of the bra ? '
negative	smug , artificial , ill-constructed and fatally overlong . . . it never finds a consistent tone and lacks bite , degenerating into a pious , preachy soap opera . 
negative	its and pieces of the hot chick are so hilarious , and schneider's performance is so fine , it's a real shame that so much of the movie -- again , as in the animal -- is a slapdash mess . 
negative	romanek keeps adding flourishes -- artsy fantasy sequences -- that simply feel wrong . they cheapen the overall effect . 
negative	mildly amusing . 
negative	fairly run-of-the-mill . 
negative	a muddy psychological thriller rife with miscalculations . it makes me say the obvious : abandon all hope of a good movie ye who enter here . 
negative	little more than a super-sized infomercial for the cable-sports channel and its summer x games . 
negative	the story's pathetic and the gags are puerile . 
negative	it's hard to believe that a relationship like holly and marina's could survive the hothouse emotions of teendom , and its longevity gets more inexplicable as the characterizations turn more crassly reductive . 
negative	no one can doubt the filmmakers' motives , but the guys still feels counterproductive . 
negative	well-meaning to a fault , antwone fisher manages the dubious feat of turning one man's triumph of will into everyman's romance comedy . 
negative	the film was produced by jerry bruckheimer and directed by joel schumacher , and reflects the worst of their shallow styles : wildly overproduced , inadequately motivated every step of the way and demographically targeted to please every one ( and no one ) . 
negative	they presume their audience won't sit still for a sociology lesson , however entertainingly presented , so they trot out the conventional science-fiction elements of bug-eyed monsters and futuristic women in skimpy clothes . 
negative	the most surprising thing about this film is that they are actually releasing it into theaters . 
negative	a distinctly minor effort that will be seen to better advantage on cable , especially considering its barely feature-length running time of one hour . 
negative	plays like a series of vignettes -- clips of a film that are still looking for a common through-line . 
negative	a somewhat disappointing and meandering saga . 
negative	unfunny comedy with a lot of static set ups , not much camera movement , and most of the scenes take place indoors in formal settings with motionless characters . 
negative	for a film that celebrates radical , nonconformist values , what to do in case of fire ? lazily and glumly settles into a most traditional , reserved kind of filmmaking . 
negative	for every articulate player , such as skateboarder tony hawk or bmx rider mat hoffman , are about a half dozen young turks angling to see how many times they can work the words " radical " or " suck " into a sentence . 
negative	dreary tale of middle-class angst
negative	an unremittingly ugly movie to look at , listen to , and think about , it is quite possibly the sturdiest example yet of why the dv revolution has cheapened the artistry of making a film . 
negative	a decidedly mixed bag . 
negative	the characters , cast in impossibly contrived situations , are totally estranged from reality . 
negative	this is just lazy writing . even kids deserve better . 
negative	how about starting with a more original story instead of just slapping extreme humor and gross-out gags on top of the same old crap ? 
negative	paul bettany is good at being the ultra-violent gangster wannabe , but the movie is certainly not number 1 . 
negative	elaborate special effects take centre screen , so that the human story is pushed to one side . 
negative	been there , done that . . . a thousand times already , and better . 
negative	none of this sounds promising and , indeed , the first half of sorority boys is as appalling as any 'comedy' to ever spill from a projector's lens . 
negative	while the production details are lavish , film has little insight into the historical period and its artists , particularly in how sand developed a notorious reputation . 
negative	what 'blade runner' would've looked like as a low-budget series on a uhf channel . 
negative	loud , silly , stupid and pointless . 
negative	seriously , rent the disney version . 
negative	a live-action cartoon , a fast-moving and cheerfully simplistic 88 minutes of exaggerated action put together with the preteen boy in mind . 
negative	meticulously mounted , exasperatingly well-behaved film , which ticks off kahlo's lifetime milestones with the dutiful precision of a tax accountant . 
negative	the only reason you should see this movie is if you have a case of masochism and an hour and a half to blow . 
negative	a man leaving the screening said the film was better than saving private ryan . he may have meant the internet short saving ryan's privates . but windtalkers doesn't beat that one , either . 
negative	ritchie may not have a novel thought in his head , but he knows how to pose madonna . 
negative	the whole mess boils down to a transparently hypocritical work that feels as though it's trying to set the women's liberation movement back 20 years . 
negative	if there was ever a movie where the upbeat ending feels like a copout , this is the one . 
negative	this is a picture that maik , the firebrand turned savvy ad man , would be envious of : it hijacks the heat of revolution and turns it into a sales tool . 
negative	welles groupie/scholar peter bogdanovich took a long time to do it , but he's finally provided his own broadside at publishing giant william randolph hearst . 
negative	boasts eye-catching art direction but has a forcefully quirky tone that quickly wears out its limited welcome . 
negative	rarely has a film's title served such dire warning . 
negative	shafer's feature doesn't offer much in terms of plot or acting . 
negative	despite some comic sparks , welcome to collinwood never catches fire . 
negative	all the small moments and flashbacks don't add up to much more than trite observations on the human condition . 
negative	spreads itself too thin , leaving these actors , as well as the members of the commune , short of profound characterizations
negative	i liked the original short story but this movie , even at an hour and twenty-some minutes , it's too long and it goes nowhere . 
negative	real-life strongman ahola lacks the charisma and ability to carry the film on his admittedly broad shoulders . 
negative	one of the most depressing movie-going experiences i can think of is to sit through about 90 minutes of a so-called 'comedy' and not laugh once . 
negative	insufferably naive . 
negative	i can't remember the last time i saw a movie where i wanted so badly for the protagonist to fail . 
negative	one long , numbing action sequence made up mostly of routine stuff yuen has given us before . 
negative	cruel and inhuman cinematic punishment . . . simultaneously degrades its characters , its stars and its audience . 
negative	we could have expected a little more human being , and a little less product . 
negative	grant isn't cary and bullock isn't katherine . 
negative	i'm sorry to say that this should seal the deal - arnold is not , nor will he be , back . 
negative	it looks good , but it is essentially empty . 
negative	it's hard to believe that something so short could be so flabby . 
negative	the entire point of a shaggy dog story , of course , is that it goes nowhere , and this is classic nowheresville in every sense . 
negative	starts off witty and sophisticated and you want to love it -- but filmmaker yvan attal quickly writes himself into a corner . 
negative	show me the mugging . 
negative	a sleep-inducing thriller with a single twist that everyone except the characters in it can see coming a mile away . 
negative	statham employs an accent that i think is supposed to be an attempt at hardass american but sometimes just lapses into unhidden british . 
negative	there's surely something wrong with a comedy where the only belly laughs come from the selection of outtakes tacked onto the end credits . 
negative	essentially " fatal attraction " remade for viewers who were in diapers when the original was released in 1987 . . . . this story gets sillier , not scarier , as it goes along . . . 
negative	it all comes down to whether you can tolerate leon barlow . i can't . 
negative	the logic of it all will be greek to anyone not predisposed to the movie's rude and crude humor . 
negative	there are many things that solid acting can do for a movie , but crafting something promising from a mediocre screenplay is not one of them . 
negative	[tries] to parody a genre that's already a joke in the united states . the movie is the equivalent of french hip-hop , which also seems to play on a 10-year delay . 
negative	and people make fun of me for liking showgirls</> . 
negative	there is nothing funny in this every-joke-has- been-told-a- thousand-times- before movie . 
negative	from its nauseating spinning credits sequence to a very talented but underutilized supporting cast , bartleby squanders as much as it gives out . 
negative	a lightweight , uneven action comedy that freely mingles french , japanese and hollywood cultures . 
negative	an ambitious , guilt-suffused melodrama crippled by poor casting . 
negative	does little to elaborate the conceit of setting this blood-soaked tragedy of murderous ambition in the era of richard nixon . 
negative	the film has the thrown-together feel of a summer-camp talent show : hastily written , underrehearsed , arbitrarily plotted and filled with crude humor and vulgar innuendo . 
negative	what we have here isn't a disaster , exactly , but a very handsomely produced let-down . 
negative	it's as if allen , at 66 , has stopped challenging himself . 
negative	it's deep-sixed by a compulsion to catalog every bodily fluids gag in there's something about mary and devise a parallel clone-gag . 
negative	fans of so-bad-they're-good cinema may find some fun in this jumbled mess . 
negative	was that movie nothing more than a tepid exercise in trotting out a formula that worked five years ago but has since lost its fizz ? 
negative	it's the movie equivalent of a sweaty old guy in a rain coat shopping for cheap porn . 
negative	viewers will need all the luck they can muster just figuring out who's who in this pretentious mess . 
negative	sheridan seems terrified of the book's irreverent energy , and scotches most of its ï¿½lan , humor , bile , and irony . 
negative	the fourth in a series that i'll bet most parents had thought --hoped ! -- was a fad that had long since vanished . 
negative	if you saw it on tv , you'd probably turn it off , convinced that you had already seen that movie . 
negative	starts promisingly but disintegrates into a dreary , humorless soap opera . 
negative	culkin turns his character into what is basically an anti-harry potter -- right down to the gryffindor scarf . 
negative	the movie's biggest shocks come from seeing former nymphette juliette lewis playing a salt-of-the-earth mommy named minnie and watching slim travel incognito in a ridiculous wig no respectable halloween costume shop would ever try to sell . 
negative	piccoli's performance is amazing , yes , but the symbols of loss and denial and life-at-arm's-length in the film seem irritatingly transparent . 
negative	a sustained fest of self-congratulation between actor and director that leaves scant place for the viewer . 
negative	wallace directs with such patronising reverence , it turns the stomach . 
negative	a fake street drama that keeps telling you things instead of showing them . 
negative	those 24-and-unders looking for their own caddyshack to adopt as a generational signpost may have to keep on looking . 
negative	it's clear why deuces wild , which was shot two years ago , has been gathering dust on mgm's shelf . 
negative	if you are into splatter movies , then you will probably have a reasonably good time with the salton sea . 
negative	davis the performer is plenty fetching enough , but she needs to shake up the mix , and work in something that doesn't feel like a half-baked stand-up routine . 
negative	 ( it ) highlights not so much the crime lord's messianic bent , but spacey's . 
negative	fessenden continues to do interesting work , and it would be nice to see what he could make with a decent budget . but the problem with wendigo , for all its effective moments , isn't really one of resources . 
negative	tykwer's surface flash isn't just a poor fit with kieslowski's lyrical pessimism ; it completely contradicts everything kieslowski's work aspired to , including the condition of art . 
negative	a dark comedy that goes for sick and demented humor simply to do so . the movie is without intent . 
negative	allegiance to chekhov , which director michael cacoyannis displays with somber earnestness in the new adaptation of the cherry orchard , is a particularly vexing handicap . 
negative	it has the requisite faux-urban vibe and hotter-two-years-ago rap and r&b names and references . 
negative	it's not a bad plot ; but , unfortunately , the movie is nowhere near as refined as all the classic dramas it borrows from . 
negative	no such thing breaks no new ground and treads old turf like a hippopotamus ballerina . 
negative	a wannabe comedy of manners about a brainy prep-school kid with a mrs . robinson complex founders on its own preciousness -- and squanders its beautiful women . 
negative	once the expectation of laughter has been quashed by whatever obscenity is at hand , even the funniest idea isn't funny . 
negative	by the end , you just don't care whether that cold-hearted snake petrovich ( that would be reno ) gets his comeuppance . just bring on the battle bots , please ! 
negative	slow , silly and unintentionally hilarious . 
negative	this stuck pig of a movie flails limply between bizarre comedy and pallid horror . 
negative	despite its visual virtuosity , 'naqoyqatsi' is banal in its message and the choice of material to convey it . 
negative	strident and inelegant in its 'message-movie' posturing . 
negative	the plot is romantic comedy boilerplate from start to finish . 
negative	it just goes to show , an intelligent person isn't necessarily an admirable storyteller . 
negative	none of this has the suavity or classical familiarity of bond , but much of it is good for a laugh . the problem with " xxx " is that its own action isn't very effective . 
negative	the spalding gray equivalent of a teen gross-out comedy . 
negative	if i could have looked into my future and saw how bad this movie was , i would go back and choose to skip it . fortunately , you still have that option . 
negative	this u-boat doesn't have a captain . 
negative	predictably melodramatic . 
negative	 . . . you can be forgiven for realizing that you've spent the past 20 minutes looking at your watch and waiting for frida to just die already . 
negative	despite the opulent lushness of every scene , the characters never seem to match the power of their surroundings . 
negative	the master of disguise is awful . it's pauly shore awful . don't say you weren't warned . 
negative	an ugly , revolting movie . 
negative	it desperately wants to be a wacky , screwball comedy , but the most screwy thing here is how so many talented people were convinced to waste their time . 
negative	filled with low-brow humor , gratuitous violence and a disturbing disregard for life . 
negative	harvard man is a semi-throwback , a reminiscence without nostalgia or sentimentality . 
negative	hart's war seems to want to be a character study , but apparently can't quite decide which character . 
negative	the film is all over the place , really . it dabbles all around , never gaining much momentum . 
negative	such a premise is ripe for all manner of lunacy , but kaufman and gondry rarely seem sure of where it should go . 
negative	too much of the movie feels contrived , as if the filmmakers were worried the story wouldn't work without all those gimmicks . 
negative	the obnoxious special effects , the obligatory outbursts of flatulence and the incessant , so-five-minutes-ago pop music on the soundtrack overwhelm what is left of the scruffy , dopey old hanna-barbera charm . 
negative	simone is not a bad film . it just doesn't have anything really interesting to say . 
negative	this hastily mounted production exists only to capitalize on hopkins' inclination to play hannibal lecter again , even though harris has no immediate inclination to provide a fourth book . 
negative	entertainment more disposable than hanna-barbera's half-hour cartoons ever were . 
negative	never again , while nothing special , is pleasant , diverting and modest -- definitely a step in the right direction . 
negative	showtime's starry cast could be both an asset and a detriment . those who trek to the 'plex predisposed to like it probably will enjoy themselves . but ticket-buyers with great expectations will wind up as glum as mr . de niro . 
negative	woody , what happened ? 
negative	cattaneo reworks the formula that made the full monty a smashing success . . . but neglects to add the magic that made it all work . 
negative	behan's memoir is great material for a film -- rowdy , brawny and lyrical in the best irish sense -- but sheridan has settled for a lugubrious romance . 
negative	how do you make a movie with depth about a man who lacked any ? on the evidence before us , the answer is clear : not easily and , in the end , not well enough . 
negative	lyne's latest , the erotic thriller unfaithful , further demonstrates just how far his storytelling skills have eroded . 
negative	as his circle of friends keeps getting smaller one of the characters in long time dead says 'i'm telling you , this is f * * * ed' . maybe he was reading the minds of the audience . 
negative	the movie is too amateurishly square to make the most of its own ironic implications . 
negative	no amount of burning , blasting , stabbing , and shooting can hide a weak script . 
negative	ultimately this is a frustrating patchwork : an uneasy marriage of louis begley's source novel ( about schmidt ) and an old payne screenplay . 
negative	bears is even worse than i imagined a movie ever could be . 
negative	[a] boldly stroked , luridly coloured , uni-dimensional nonsense machine that strokes the eyeballs while it evaporates like so much crypt mist in the brain . 
negative	shame on writer/director vicente aranda for making a florid biopic about mad queens , obsessive relationships , and rampant adultery so dull . 
negative	remember back when thrillers actually thrilled ? when the twist endings were actually surprising ? when the violence actually shocked ? when the heroes were actually under 40 ? sadly , as blood work proves , that was a long , long time ago . 
negative	a sloppy slapstick throwback to long gone bottom-of-the-bill fare like the ghost and mr . chicken . 
negative	it's supposed to be a humorous , all-too-human look at how hope can breed a certain kind of madness -- and strength -- but it never quite adds up . 
negative	rashomon-for-dipsticks tale . 
negative	although it starts off so bad that you feel like running out screaming , it eventually works its way up to merely bad rather than painfully awful . 
negative	while the story is better-focused than the incomprehensible anne rice novel it's based upon , queen of the damned is a pointless , meandering celebration of the goth-vampire , tortured woe-is-me lifestyle . 
negative	stealing harvard will dip into your wallet , swipe 90 minutes of your time , and offer you precisely this in recompense : a few early laughs scattered around a plot as thin as it is repetitious . 
negative	never decides whether it wants to be a black comedy , drama , melodrama or some combination of the three . 
negative	like a bad improvisation exercise , the superficially written characters ramble on tediously about their lives , loves and the art they're struggling to create . 
negative	this thing is virtually unwatchable . 
negative	in terms of execution this movie is careless and unfocused . 
negative	the trouble is , its filmmakers run out of clever ideas and visual gags about halfway through . 
negative	an uneasy mix of run-of-the-mill raunchy humor and seemingly sincere personal reflection . 
negative	the sort of picture in which , whenever one of the characters has some serious soul searching to do , they go to a picture-perfect beach during sunset . 
negative	an extraordinarily silly thriller . 
negative	the stunt work is top-notch ; the dialogue and drama often food-spittingly funny . 
negative	the film . . . presents classic moral-condundrum drama : what would you have done to survive ? the problem with the film is whether these ambitions , laudable in themselves , justify a theatrical simulation of the death camp of auschwitz ii-birkenau . 
negative	this is a monumental achievement in practically every facet of inept filmmaking : joyless , idiotic , annoying , heavy-handed , visually atrocious , and often downright creepy . 
negative	yet another self-consciously overwritten story about a rag-tag bunch of would-be characters that team up for a can't-miss heist -- only to have it all go wrong . 
negative	it's hard to pity the 'plain' girl who becomes a ravishing waif after applying a smear of lip-gloss . rather , pity anyone who sees this mishmash . 
negative	as earnest as a community-college advertisement , american chai is enough to make you put away the guitar , sell the amp , and apply to medical school . 
negative	it's not a particularly good film , but neither is it a monsterous one . 
negative	[lin chung's] voice is rather unexceptional , even irritating ( at least to this western ear ) , making it awfully hard to buy the impetus for the complicated love triangle that develops between the three central characters . 
negative	it should be doing a lot of things , but doesn't . 
negative	i was hoping that it would be sleazy and fun , but it was neither . 
negative	the filmmakers keep pushing the jokes at the expense of character until things fall apart . 
negative	the lead actors share no chemistry or engaging charisma . we don't even like their characters . 
negative	spectators will indeed sit open-mouthed before the screen , not screaming but yawning . 
negative	did we really need a remake of " charade ? " 
negative	the satire is just too easy to be genuinely satisfying . 
negative	an awful movie that will only satisfy the most emotionally malleable of filmgoers . 
negative	one key problem with these ardently christian storylines is that there is never any question of how things will turn out . 
negative	leaves viewers out in the cold and undermines some phenomenal performances . 
negative	diaz , applegate , blair and posey are suitably kooky which should appeal to women and they strip down often enough to keep men alert , if not amused . 
negative	eckstraordinarily lame and severely boring . 
negative	in his determination to lighten the heavy subject matter , silberling also , to a certain extent , trivializes the movie with too many nervous gags and pratfalls . 
negative	final verdict : you've seen it all before . 
negative	the movie is a little tired ; maybe the original inspiration has run its course . 
negative	debut effort by " project greenlight " winner is sappy and amateurish . 
negative	purports to be positive	the rock is destined to be the 21st century's new " conan " and that he's going to make a splash even greater than arnold schwarzenegger , jean-claud van damme or steven segal . 
positive	the film provides some great insight into the neurotic mindset of all comics -- even those who have reached the absolute top of the game . 
positive	this is a film well worth seeing , talking and singing heads and all . 
positive	an utterly compelling 'who wrote it' in which the reputation of the most famous author who ever lived comes into question . 
positive	a thoughtful , provocative , insistently humanizing film . 
positive	occasionally melodramatic , it's also extremely effective . 
positive	guaranteed to move anyone who ever shook , rattled , or rolled . 
positive	though everything might be literate and smart , it never took off and always seemed static . 
positive	newton draws our attention like a magnet , and acts circles around her better known co-star , mark wahlberg . 
positive	karmen moves like rhythm itself , her lips chanting to the beat , her long , braided hair doing little to wipe away the jeweled beads of sweat . 
positive	an engaging overview of johnson's eccentric career . 
positive	everytime you think undercover brother has run out of steam , it finds a new way to surprise and amuse . 
positive	a pleasant enough movie , held together by skilled ensemble actors . 
positive	the invincible werner herzog is alive and well and living in la
positive	a taut , intelligent psychological drama . 
positive	the appearance of treebeard and gollum's expanded role will either have you loving what you're seeing , or rolling your eyes . i loved it ! gollum's 'performance' is incredible ! 
positive	it's the best film of the year so far , the benchmark against which all other best picture contenders should be measured . 
positive	while the isle is both preposterous and thoroughly misogynistic , its vistas are incredibly beautiful to look at . 
positive	doug liman , the director of bourne , directs the traffic well , gets a nice wintry look from his locations , absorbs us with the movie's spycraft and uses damon's ability to be focused and sincere . 
positive	if nothing else , this movie introduces a promising , unusual kind of psychological horror . 
positive	chicago is sophisticated , brash , sardonic , completely joyful in its execution . 
positive	if it's possible for a sequel to outshine the original , then sl2 does just that . 
positive	a feel-good picture in the best sense of the term . 
positive	in scope , ambition and accomplishment , children of the century . . . takes kurys' career to a whole new level . 
positive	digital-video documentary about stand-up comedians is a great glimpse into a very different world . 
positive	a thunderous ride at first , quiet cadences of pure finesse are few and far between ; their shortage dilutes the potency of otherwise respectable action . still , this flick is fun , and host to some truly excellent sequences . 
positive	it's not exactly a gourmet meal but the fare is fair , even coming from the drive-thru . 
positive	an original gem about an obsession with time . 
positive	it's a minor comedy that tries to balance sweetness with coarseness , while it paints a sad picture of the singles scene . 
positive	far from perfect , but its heart is in the right place . . . innocent and well-meaning . 
positive	enormously likable , partly because it is aware of its own grasp of the absurd . 
positive	everything that has to do with yvan and charlotte , and everything that has to do with yvan's rambunctious , jewish sister and her non-jew husband , feels funny and true . 
positive	the film is faithful to what one presumes are the book's twin premises -- that we become who we are on the backs of our parents , but we have no idea who they were at our age ; and that time is a fleeting and precious commodity no matter how old you are . 
positive	a well-made thriller with a certain level of intelligence and non-reactionary morality .

positive	engagingly captures the maddening and magnetic ebb and flow of friendship . 
positive	a droll , well-acted , character-driven comedy with unexpected deposits of feeling . 
positive	one of the best , most understated performances of [jack nicholson's] career . 
positive	children may not understand everything that happens -- i'm not sure even miyazaki himself does -- but they will almost certainly be fascinated , and undoubtedly delighted . 
positive	whether you're moved and love it , or bored or frustrated by the film , you'll still feel something . 
positive	without heavy-handedness , dong provides perspective with his intelligent grasp of human foibles and contradictions . 
positive	a somewhat crudely constructed but gripping , questing look at a person so racked with self-loathing , he becomes an enemy to his own race . 
positive	at its best early on as it plays the culture clashes between the brothers . 
positive	tsai ming-liang has taken his trademark style and refined it to a crystalline point . 
positive	daring , mesmerizing and exceedingly hard to forget . 
positive	mr . parker has brilliantly updated his source and grasped its essence , composing a sorrowful and hilarious tone poem about alienated labor , or an absurdist workplace sitcom . 
positive	day is not a great bond movie , but it is a good bond movie , which still makes it much better than your typical bond knock-offs . 
positive	i admired it , particularly that unexpected downer of an ending . 
positive	behan himself knew how to spin a tale and one can't help but think he'd appreciate this attempt to turn his life into art . 
positive	you might not buy the ideas . but you'll definitely want the t-shirt . 
positive	a thoughtful , moving piece that faces difficult issues with honesty and beauty . 
positive	the director , steven shainberg , has succeeded by focusing intently on his characters , making them quirky individuals rather than figures of fun . 
positive	 . . . understands that a generation defines its music as much as the music defines a generation .
