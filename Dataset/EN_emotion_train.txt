none	Earth' is an easier movie
none	Richard and Sheryl are raising two children, the cute but seemingly unremarkable Olive (Breslin) and the perpetually silent, glum, and angry Dwayne (Dano), who is marking off the days until he can go join the Air Force and escape this familial hellhole
none	Little seven-year-old Olive (Abigail Breslin) has one wish in life: to be considered for the finals of the Little Miss Sunshine Pageant in Redondo Beach, CA
none	I bought the movie on DVD the day it came out and have been watching it everday since that day!
none	We see each murder, save two, after the fact, as a crime scene
none	10/1
none	Sometimes those same fans even end up hating the movie, or not even giving it a chance by seeing it
none	It skips much of the scientific detail that Attenborough covers in his 'Planet Earth' series
none	When two men, wake up and find themselves chained to a bathroom pipe, with a dead body lying in between them, they soon realize that they are prisoners, in the secure lair of a serial killer, nicknamed 'Jigsaw'
none	The mouthpiece for this thematic undercurrent is Somerset, a literate man who also happens to be a detective, a man who can read a clue ("This isn't going to be a happy ending") or Dante's Inferno with equal aplomb
none	Score 10/1
none	There was a lot of laughter going on - especially at the hilarious ending
none	Noah is from a one- parent family, and sees himself working at a lumber-yard for the better part of his life
none	He and Somerset have arrived at the same conclusion, the difference between them being how they have responded
none	I "discovered" this movie right here at IMDb, having heard not a peep about it beforehand
none	Our hero even shows definite signs of physical vulnerability despite a very high level of training and competence
none	This dark tale of murder and crime revolves around two detectives in present New York city played by two brilliant actors `Brad Pitt' and `Morgan Freeman' who are paired together to solve a puzzle of murder that is at the hands of a man who kills regarding to the seven deadly sins
none	Here is a simple story in which our lovely contestant and her family try to find their way to California so that she can prove to the world she is not a loser
none	It is this frail balance that has been fatally disrupted by the selfishness of our own species.'Aside from these main stories, we are also treated to brief snippets of wildlife from around the world, including the birds of paradise of Papua New Guinea, and the autumn migration of the demoiselle cranes
none	The story is about a surgeon and a photographer who wake up and to find themselves shackled at opposite ends of a nasty-looking toilet
none	Lately, the film industry has been lacking the sort of element that I love to see in a movie
none	These guys don't feel like much of a family at first, and I wondered a couple of times why these people would bother sticking together, but as things progress the strengths of this particular family unit become obvious
none	Gradually, Jason begins to put the pieces back together again, especially when he discovers that unknown individuals are out to kill him for reasons beyond him
none	I saw Little Miss Sunshine a week ago at the Sydney Film Festival, and the audience I saw it with loved it
none	For instance, Earth will tell you that a tropical sea is an ideal nursery for a young humpback whale, because there are few predators
none	Spycraft is not all about technical gizmos, but requires human brains and human brawn (and a fair amount of gunplay and car chases)
none	It's bad enough he lost it to Cuba Gooding Jr. when he was in Primal Fear, which was yet another incredible performance by him
none	Kevin Spacey is another great actor that has great range and really puts life and personality into his characters
none	Morgan Freeman is a great actor
none	There are probably several things that work in the book that would either be boring and take too much screen time to explain, or would be viewed as cliche to modern screen audiences
none	And of course, Kevin Spacey who plays the diabolical yet misunderstood serial killer
none	You can always count on him to do what he does best which is play a wise veteran that has seen it all
none	As someone who has trained in martial arts for over 10 years, unrealistic fight scenes are a pet peeve
none	Not a single moment is wasted  not a single scene is in this film without having a reason for being there, and it's all character-driven
none	His quirkiness, perhaps the outgrowth of a brilliant mind, is no worse than that of any prophet or seer of old, those harbingers of Biblical insight whom others always find kooky and offbeat
none	All actors who have found their niches before, and were brought in to this film to help carry the story
none	Go see it and be thoroughly entertained
none	I was expecting a kind of a moralistic movie with an overly present, almost preaching like message
none	When her big chance comes at the most unexpected time, it's up to her unbelievably fractured family to pull themselves together and make it happen for her, no matter what it takes
none	I went to see this film with my sister and my Mum and we were the only ones in the cinema
none	Sure, the cops are depicted way too stupid and the killer is unrealistically smart, outshining each and every opponent with his perfect plans, but hey, "Se7en" and "Silence Of The Lambs" didn't care too much about realism, either, did they?'"Saw" does have some flaws
none	It shows what is NOT the solution to the problems and that everything that is occurring is like a vicious circle
none	To me, that's an important difference
none	Amnesia is a tricky thing to sell to an audience for credibility but this is a rare exception
none	Andrew Kevin Walker must have some incredible demons living inside him
none	There are no huge plots twists, but I think you'll have more fun with this film if you don't know exactly where it's going
none	This is untrue
none	Most go for the scare and have no plot, so when they aren't scary they suck
none	As I said earlier in my review, I did go into the movie not expecting much and that was because I thought it was a typical "boy loves girl" movie which are sometimes just too predictable
none	Does its best to make the point that no one is ever right aand no one is ever wrong
none	Sometimes both at the same time
none	Unlike many other movies from the same genre, the movie is slow paced and takes it time to develop the characters without falling into some obvious clich�'s
none	if you can't handle a little of that, you probably should stick to disney films or tv's scooby doo where everything is explained in the end.
